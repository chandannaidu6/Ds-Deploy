                Teaching involves planning and implementation of instructional activities and experiences to meet intended learning outcomes according to a specific teaching plan. Learning is a change in an individual behavior (Knowledge, Skill or Attitude) that can occur to a learner (student) as a result of teaching. Therefore the Teaching-Learning-Process is the most powerful instrument of education to bring about the desired changes in students. The program curriculum which is designed by the university is followed by our institution/ department as an affiliating body to the university, is an outcome based education that facilitates the students to acquire or possess a pre-defined set of graduating attributes described in the form of POs and PSOs.
