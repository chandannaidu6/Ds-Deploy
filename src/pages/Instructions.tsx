                Guidelines:
            </div>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 text-justify">
                    <li>Students are advised to concentrate in their holistic development during their tenure in the college. They are profusely encouraged to make use of the Library, laboratories, R&D lab and Internet facilities for carrying their projects/improving their technical and academic skills.</li>
                    <li>Students are encouraged to actively interact with the faculty members in the pursuit of achieving excellence in academics. They are advised to meet their faculty mentors and take suggestions from them.</li>
                    <li>Always occupy the front seats available in the class room. Never leave the front seats vacant and occupy the back seats. It is desirable that only 2 students sit in a bench whenever and wherever it is possible.</li>

They are advised to read English news paper daily to improve the reading comprehension.</li>
                    <li>Students should carry out as many technical projects as they can during their study in the college which helps them to assimilate the concepts of a course in a better way.</li>
